# OdyseeDL

I created a few bash scripts to download videos from Odysee 

OdyseeMP4 downloads the video from the Odysee URL

OdyseeMP3 downloads the video and converts it to MP3

You need to have wget and ffmpeg installed on your system



# How to use :

Download the script

use chmod +x 

Run the script

./OdyseeMP4


The script will prompt you for the URL of your Odysee video you can paste it here, then it will prompt you for the desired file name

Odysee URL ?

https://odysee.com/@Mokso:2/metal-t-rex-model-kit-shorts:2

File name ?

Trex.mp4



Now your file is downloaded.
